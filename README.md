# 🧠 LLM Agents Final Project

## 🛍️ AI-Powered Shopping Assistant

An **AI-driven shopping assistant** designed to enhance customer experience and optimize e-commerce operations using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
This system enables natural language interaction for product discovery, cart management, and automated customer support, while reducing human workload and maintaining high-quality service.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

The project simulates the development of an intelligent shopping assistant for a major e-commerce company.  
It aims to:  

- Improve **customer experience** through conversational product search and personalized recommendations.  
- Increase **operational efficiency** by automating common support interactions.  

The assistant can handle real-world scenarios such as:  

- Searching for “healthy breakfast options.”  
- Adding or removing items from the shopping cart.  
- Requesting refunds or reporting defective products.  
- Maintaining multi-turn conversation context and escalating complex issues to human support when needed.  

---

## 🧩 Data  

The assistant is powered by a **grocery store dataset** containing:  

- **49,000+ products** with names, departments, aisles, and prices.  
- **Historical order data** reflecting customer purchase behavior.  

The system uses:  

- **Structured search** (SQL-like filtering) for precise product queries.  
- **Semantic search** (via embeddings) to interpret natural language queries.  
- **Session memory** to maintain user context and cart state across conversations.
